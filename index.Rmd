## Welcome!

We're a group of graduate students in the Department of Statistics at the University of Michigan interested in applications of statistics to problems of societal interest. Our reading group is meant to be a relaxed environment for discussion, clarification, and inquiry into the many challenges of deploying statistics in the real world.

## Spring/Summer 2021

Focus: Applications in medicine, public policy, and the health sciences. Additionally, inspired by the  <a href="https://rlbarter.github.io/Practical-Statistics/about/">Practical Statistics</a> group at Berkeley, we will cover methods that are commonly used in statistical applications (especially in other disciplines) but not often taught in statistics courses.

Time: Every other Tuesday, 2-3pm
